# Welcome to the University of Delaware's ACM-W Chapter!

We are a group of students that support women and non-binary people in technology-driven fields at UD. We like to hang out together to chat and discuss professional or technical topics, as well as to serve as a support group for ourselves and other students. Our goal is to promote women and nonbinary people in technology at UD, have fun and help students succeed in college. ACM-W is open to all undergraduate, graduate, and faculty in technology driven fields. Anyone is welcome to join us. We are a registered chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery's Council on Women in Computing (ACM-W). Learn more about our parent organization here!
